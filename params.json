  "body": "### Summary\r\nWe are going to implement a parallel version of high resolution dynamic fluid simulation algorithms based on the Navier-Stokes equations which describes the motion of viscous fluids. We'll use the CUDA enabled NVIDA GTX 780 GPU in order to exploit the large amount of parallelism in graphics hardware. Another goal of this project is to compare performance against a 2.2 GHz intel core i7 processor.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n### The Challenge\r\n* The primary challenge of our project is to deal with the dependencies between the different steps in the sequential algorithm. The sequential algorithm first applies advection forces, followed by diffusion, external forces and then subtracts the pressure gradient to obtain a final result for that step. Finding a way to eliminate dependencies between these steps to maximize performance and maintain correctness is going to be one of the main focuses of our algorithm.\r\n* A limitation of the numerical steps of the Navier-Stokes algorithm is that most of them cannot be done in place. This requires us to store temporary values. This would require us to store temporary values at each step for each pixel and then accessing each of these values for the next step. Figuring out a way to manage the lack of in-place algorithms/coming up with in-place algorithms will have a major impact on memory access latencies and cache locality of our algorithm.\r\n* In terms of workload, instruction stream divergence at the boundaries of the fluid or different parts of the fluid at different velocities will affect the efficiency of our code through work imbalance between SIMD execution units. Since we'll be working over tens of thousands of pixels, utilizing the full capability of the GPU should not be an issue.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n### Goals & Deliverables\r\n\r\n### Platform Choice\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\nDate | Goals\r\n------------ | -------------\r\n**10th April, Sunday**  | Complete a sequential implementation of the Navier Stokes equation that works on small grid dimensions.\r\n**15th April, Friday**  | Setup a graphical representation of our implementation to visually see the fluid simulation\r\n**22nd April, Friday**  | Parallelize the sequential implementation for the NVIDIA GTX 780 GPU\r\n**29th April, Friday**  | Optimize the parallel implementation to achieve a higher speedup.
