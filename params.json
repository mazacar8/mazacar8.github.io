The simulator is based on the Navier-Stokes equations which describes the motion of viscous fluids. Another goal of this project is to compare performance against a 2.2 GHz intel core i7 processor.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nhttp://github.com - automatic!\r\n[GitHub](http://github.com)\r\n \r\n### The Challenge\r\n* The primary challenge of our project is to deal with the dependencies between the different steps in the sequential algorithm. The sequential algorithm first applies advection forces, followed by diffusion, external forces and then subtracts the pressure gradient to obtain a final result for that step. Finding a way to eliminate dependencies between these steps to maximize performance and maintain correctness is going to be one of the main focuses of our algorithm.\r\n* A limitation of the numerical steps of the Navier-Stokes algorithm is that most of them cannot be done in place. This requires us to store temporary values. This would require us to store temporary values at each step for each pixel and then accessing each of these values for the next step. Figuring out a way to manage the lack of in-place algorithms/coming up with in-place algorithms will have a major impact on memory access latencies and cache locality of our algorithm.\r\n* In terms of workload, instruction stream divergence at the boundaries of the fluid or different parts of the fluid at different velocities will affect the efficiency of our code through work imbalance between SIMD execution units. Since we'll be working over tens of thousands of pixels, utilizing the full capability of the GPU should not be an issue.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n* The ghc41 machine has the NVIDIA GTX 780 GPU and machines 47-84 have the i7 processor that we need.\r\n* We plan to start from scratch without starter code.\r\n* We will be using CUDA and OpenMP API.\r\n* Also, we will need to use libraries for graphics support in C++ and will require guidance for this.\r\n* Two articles we have so far referenced are:\r\n  * http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch38.html\r\n  * http://cse.mathe.uni-jena.de/pub/diplom/fritzsche.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n### Goals & Deliverables\r\n**Plan To Achieve**\r\n* A parallel implementation to solve the Navier-Stokes differential equation that produces a significant speedup on the GPU in comparison to a CPU implementation.\r\n* A simple and clear visual representation of this fluid simulation in real time.\r\n* Graphs or timing analysis to show speedup from the sequential implementation.\r\n\r\n**Hope To Achieve**\r\n* A parallel CPU implementation of the algorithm.\r\n* A detailed comparison between the CPU and GPU implementation with support of graphs and timing data.\r\n* Modify the fluid simulator to take into account external, real time forces.\r\n\r\n**Demo**\r\n\r\nFor the demo, we hope to showcase a few examples of visual fluid simulation and explain the speedup obtained because of using the GPU with support from analytical data we collect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Platform Choice\r\nWe will be implementing the simulator in C++ using the CUDA platform to work with the NVIDIA GTX 780 GPU. The ghc41 lab machine contains this GPU. For the CPU implementation, we will use the quad-core 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 processors which are contained in ghc[47 -84]. The OpenMP API would be used to support parallelism on the CPU. \r\n\r\nThese systems are a good choice for our fluid simulator since the GPU is the fastest one available and is well suited to a compute-intensive project due to high scope for parallelism. The i7 processor would be a good benchmark to analyze CPU performance and compare it with the GPU's performance.\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\nDate | Goals\r\n------------ | -------------\r\n**April 10, Sunday**  | Complete a sequential implementation of the Navier Stokes equation that works on small grid dimensions.\r\n**April 15, Friday**  | Setup a graphical representation of our implementation to visually see the fluid simulation.\r\n**April 22, Friday**  | Parallelize the sequential implementation for the NVIDIA GTX 780 GPU.\r\n**April 29, Friday**  | Optimize the parallel implementation to achieve a higher speedup. Parallelize for the i7 processor and compare results with the GPU.\r\n**May 06, Friday**  | Explore further possibilities and additions to the project and improve the graphical interface.\r\n",
